--------------------------------------
 
 Here's the change list for: 1.3 

--------------------------------------
A big Thanks to NAW for the use of some of their vehicles.
A big Thanks to SatNav for the use of some of his vehicles and weapons.
Thanks again to Chullster for the use of his account to test kit unlocks!

CHANGES:
- For the first time in Hard Justice history we will be releasing a Linux version. (by Cerberus)
- Most ground and air vehicles have been recoded for better usability.
- Unlocks added to all armies! (US CH MEC 2 and 3 kits and CA EU kits)
- Added 5 more seats to APC Cobra and APC CobraAT Vehicles
- Added 2 more seats to Bradly
- Completely recoded the lean for the Dirt Bike for much better stability!
- All handheld weapons accuracy, recoil and damage have been adjusted.
- Mp5 smg added to US CA EU assault kits with G3 and sniper kits with L96A1 and M24 in place of the pistol.
- Type85 added to CH MEC assault kits with AK47 or AK101 and sniper kits with Type88 and Dragunov in place of the pistol.
- Nuke kill zone made much larger and more powerful.

ADDED:

NEW Items:
- Designator (Original concept by BiggDogg, coded into game by Ziggy and BiggDogg) We're really excited about this addition! The Designator replaces the laser target painter (SIMRAD). This new laser target painter allows the user to paint an object so that a laser guided bomb can strike that object! The new ability allows the user to "designate" an object that does not have a laser object already attached to it (i.e. Artillery,ground and buildings). But it can not be used to target soldiers! The new Designator is located in the Spec Ops and Sniper Kits. The MH6 Transport Littlebird pilot is also able to designate targets!

KNOWN ISSUES:
- All Hard Justice Helicopters may have graphical "hitching" which resembles lag, on dedicated servers! We're unable to find the source of the "hitching" but there is a workaround. Jump into any stock BF2 choppers pilot seat for a second then jump out and retry the Hard Justice choppers and the hitching should be greatly reduced or eliminated! This only has to be done once until the game is exited.

- The designators target doesn't always stick in the desired place on the ground or buildings! Just reposition for a different angle and retry marking the target!

- The SA7 and Javelin top seek targeting and lock sounds continue to play after you unzoom. This is a limitation in BF2. The workaround is to switch weapons or to go back into zoomed view with no targets in view or point it at the ground then unzoom again!

- The Jeep Technical reargunner is at times invincible.
